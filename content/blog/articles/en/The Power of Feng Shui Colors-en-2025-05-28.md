Incorporating red accents such as candles, artwork, or textiles can stimulate enthusiasm and drive in your endeavors.

### Blue
Blue represents tranquility, calmness, and clarity. As the color of the Water element, blue is ideal for promoting relaxation and peace within a space. Adding shades of blue through decor, such as cushions, curtains, or wall paint, can help create a serene atmosphere conducive to meditation and introspection.

### Green
Green symbolizes growth, renewal, and harmony, embodying the Wood element in Feng Shui. It is associated with health, abundance, and vitality. Introducing plants, greenery, or decorative items in shades of green can foster a sense of balance and well-being in your surroundings.

### Yellow
Yellow is a bright and uplifting color that represents joy, optimism, and intellect. As the color of the Earth element, yellow is linked to stability and nourishment. Incorporating yellow accents like throw pillows, rugs, or artwork can bring warmth and positivity to a room, fostering a welcoming and inviting atmosphere.

By strategically incorporating these Feng Shui colors into your living or working space, you can create a harmonious environment that supports your goals and well-being. Experiment with different color combinations and observe how they influence the energy flow and ambiance of your surroundings.
