In Feng Shui, your home's layout can influence your financial well-being. One way to attract wealth and prosperity is by activating the wealth corners in your living space. Every home has specific wealth corners based on the Bagua map.

To enhance the wealth corners in your home:
1. **Identify Wealth Corners**: Use a compass to determine the southeast corner (associated with wealth and abundance) and the north corner (related to career and opportunities).
2. **Clear Clutter**: Remove any clutter or obstacles blocking these areas to allow positive energy (Chi) flow freely.
3. **Add Elements and Colors**: Decorate these corners with elements and colors that represent wealth, such as water features, plants, or shades of purple, red, or green.
4. **Activate with Symbols**: Place symbols of prosperity like money plants, gemstones, or wealth bowls in these corners to enhance the positive energy.

By optimizing your wealth corners, you can create a supportive environment that aligns with your financial goals and aspirations. Remember to regularly refresh and maintain these areas to sustain the flow of prosperity in your home.
